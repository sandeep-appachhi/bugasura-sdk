Integration
Appachhi SDK is build with two binaries (SDK and Plugin)

SDK
It does much of the tasks like monitoring various metric and saving the information to the database. You can find details here. In order to integrate the SDK to an existing project, you can add the sdk.aar into the src/main/libs/ directory in your app module.

Also update the project level build.gradle file as follows

 ` allprojects {
      repositories {
          google()
          jcenter()
          flatDir {
              dirs 'src/main/libs'
          }
      }
  }`
  
Plugin
In order to add integrate the plugin, you need to add the plugin.jar file in top level libs directory.If folder doesn't exist,then create one.

Now in you project level build.gradle add the following lines

`  buildscript {
      dependencies {
          classpath files("libs/plugin.jar")
      }
  }`
  
Update the app level build.gradle as follow

apply plugin: 'com.appachhi.plugin'
Other information
SDK will automatically be initialized as soon as the app launches and it will start collecting data

In order to gather information regarding method trace, you can annotate a method as show below

    @Trace(name = "Your Trace Name")
    publicpublic void foo(){
    // Any code
    }
    
As soon as the app launches, you will be asked to grant permission to show an overlay. If you allow then an overlay will be show where you can see the captured data

All the data are currently saved in database too
